## Installation

Place the `.js` file in your project and import the class so that you can 
instantiate a PayWhirl object. 

When you create a new PayWhirl object you need to pass in your API key and 
secret, which can be found in the [API key section of the main site](https://app.paywhirl.com/api-keys).
```
// include PayWhirl JavaScript SDK
const PayWhirl = require('./paywhirl.js');

const apiKey = 'pwpk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
const apiSecret = 'pwpsk_xxxxxxxxxxx';

const paywhirl = new PayWhirl(apiKey, apiSecret);


```
